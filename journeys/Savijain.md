# Savi Jain: Tech Explorer

Hey! I am Savi, from India. I am a JAVA programmer and currently learning .net framework. I have keen interest in developing software applications. I am also trying to improve myself in competitive programming. Apart from these, I love to paint and dance.
I was Head of Design and Head of Marketing and Sponsorship in a Social Outreach Club.

# My journey

I came to know about different programming languages in my first year of college. I started my coding journey by learning JAVA language. I loved it. After getting well versed with it, I started competitive programming on websites like codeforces, leetcode etc.
I tried my hands on software development during college projects.
